## Introduction

To provide a consistent user interface and navigation experience, we have integrated the AppLayout component into all user management pages. AppLayout provides a unified header, sidebar, and footer, ensuring a consistent experience as users navigate between different pages.

## Integrated Pages

The following user management pages have been integrated with AppLayout:

1. **User List Page** - `/users`
2. **Create User Page** - `/users/create`
3. **User Detail Page** - `/users/[id]`
4. **Edit User Page** - `/users/[id]/edit`

## Implementation Details

### Import Path

All pages use the following import statement to import AppLayout:

```astro
import AppLayout from '../../../../example/src/layout/AppLayout.astro';
```

### Page Wrapper

The content of each page is wrapped in the AppLayout component:

```astro
<AppLayout
    title="Page Title"
    description="Page Description">
    <!-- Page Content -->
</AppLayout>
```

### Page Metadata

Each page provides appropriate titles and descriptions:

- **User List Page**: "User Management" / "Manage user accounts"
- **Create User Page**: "Create New User" / "Create a new user account"
- **User Detail Page**: "User Detail - [Username]" / "View detailed information for user [Username]"
- **Edit User Page**: "Edit User - [Username]" / "Edit information for user [Username]"

## Style Preservation

Despite integrating AppLayout, each page retains its original style, ensuring visual consistency while maintaining the uniqueness of each page.

## Navigation Consistency

By using AppLayout, all user management pages now have the same navigation menu, allowing users to easily switch between the following pages:

- Home
- Management Page
- User List
- Create User

## Responsive Design

AppLayout provides responsive design, ensuring that user management pages display properly on various devices.

## Notes

1. AppLayout depends on the configuration in the example project, so the correct relative path is needed when using it in the core package
2. All page titles and descriptions are localized to support both Chinese and English display
3. Navigation links between pages remain unchanged to ensure users can browse normally
